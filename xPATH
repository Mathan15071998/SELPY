xPATH defined as xml path which is a syntax or element for finding any element  on the webpage
using xml path expression. It is used to find the location of any element on a webpage using HTML DOM (Document Object Model).
xpath basically works based on the DOM.xpath can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in DOM.
Xpath is an address of the element.

Types of xpath:
1)Absolute XPATH-full xpath-/html/body/nav/div/div[2]/div[2]/ul/li[2]/a/button
2)Relative Xpath-partial xpath-//*[@id="navbarSupportedContent"]/div[2]/ul/li[2]/a/button


Difference bw relative and full xpath:
1)Absolute Xpath always start from the root HTML code while relative xpath directly jump to element on DOM.
2)Absolute Xpath starts with / while relative xpath starts with //
3)In Absolute Xpath we will only specify the tags or nodes while in relative Xpath we will the attributes and it's value.

In html, we call the tags as tags while in xpath or DOM, we call them as nodes.


How to write xpath manually:
Absolute:html/body/div[6]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a-register fucntionality's manual full xpath
relative xpath-//input[@id="small-searchterms"]- here if we don't know the tag name then we can just mention star.

How to capture xpath automatically:
1)Firebug, firepath(for firefox- now it's depricated)
2)Browser inbuild feature,  by inspect,highlight and copy either full/relative xpath.
3)selectors hub extension- available in each Browser.- This will give us not only xpath but 
also all the locators will be displayed. This will also check the xpath we written is correct or not.



Which Xpath is preferred the mose? It's relative because, it is more stable than Absolute Xpath(If dev 
introduced some new features then Absolute Xpath will be broken).
And if dev changed the location of the element then address of the element will be changed.
