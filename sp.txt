                                        SELENIUM WITH PYTHON
    
    SELENIUM WEBDRIVER- webdriver here is a component in selenium which used to automate web applications.
    
    WebDriver is a module withrespct to module(In Java we call it as a interface).(Module contains functions, 
classes and etc.)
    i,e.,
        Firefox browser- Firefox()
        Chrome browser- Chrome()

    WebDriver is an API(Application Programming Interface)


    Any Web application will have 3 layers which are UI(Presentation layer), Application web server(Business LOGIC)
and Database(backend layer).

    Business LOGIC will contain more number of programs with multiple classes, collectively those are called
API's. This API will act as a bridge bw frontend and backend. We find API'S with lot of functions and methods
and at the same time WebDriver also contains those much methods and functions so we can call it as API.
